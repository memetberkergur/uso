Dear {{project.spokesperson}},

{%if project.new %}Your project titled "{{project.title}}" has now been reviewed{% if project.approved %} and approved for beam time during the
cycle "{{cycle}}"{% endif %}. The final results of the review process including comments from reviewers
are available at {{submission_urls}}.{% else %}The renewal request submitted for the project "{{project.title}}" has now been
processed.{% endif %}

Your project is valid between {{project.start_date}} and {{project.end_date}}.

Additional safety reviews may be required prior to the start of your experiments. Some of these
reviews may need additional information which you will be required to provide. Please consult your project page at
{{project_url}} to monitor the progress and access all information related to your project. The results of the allocation,
are detailed below:

{% for alloc in allocations %}
{{alloc.beamline}} ({{alloc.beamline.name}}):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
{%if alloc.beamline.flex_schedule or project.special %}{%if project.special %}Shifts have not been allocated to your project.{% else %}
This beamline does not allocate shifts.{% endif %} Scheduling is done on request based on
availability and prioritized by the peer-review score. Beam time requests can be made directly from your project page
at anytime during the valid period of the project.
{% else %}{% if alloc.shifts %}The project was allocated "{{alloc.shifts|floatformat}}" shifts during the "{{cycle}}" cycle.
Scheduling of specific shifts is now in progress.{% else %} Unfortunately, due to the large number of high-quality
submissions on this beamline, your project has not been allocated any beam time for the "{{cycle}}" cycle. {% endif %}
{% if not special %}
To request beam time after the "{{cycle}}" cycle, you will have to renew your project on this beamline. Renewals can
be submitted directly from your project page when the next Call For Proposals is open. Renewals can only be submitted for
cycles which occur during the valid period of your project. Renewal request will be evaluated relative to other projects
requesting beam time for the same cycle. You may chose to improve your score by submitting an improved proposal instead
of a renewal.
{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}

{% if project.approved %}We look forward to having you as a user during the "{{cycle}}" cycle.{% endif %}

Sincerely,
The CLS Users Office Team
