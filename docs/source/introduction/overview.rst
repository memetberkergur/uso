Background
----------
The User Services Online (USO) is an information management system developed at
the Canadian Light Source which manages information related to the use of a
large-scale research facility, such as a synchrotron.


Purpose
-------
The purpose of the USO system is to provide a comprehensive platform for managing the lifecycle of user interactions
with a research facility, from initial registration and proposal submission through to experiment execution and
publication tracking. It aims to streamline processes, enhance user experience, and ensure compliance with safety
ethical standards for research. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for customization and
adaptation to the specific needs of different facilities.
