Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

A list of common questions from users, administrators, and developers.

How do I ...
------------

- **Register as a new user?**
   The registration page can be accessed through a link at the bottom of the login form. Complete all
   steps of the form wizard and submit the form. You will receive an email with a link to confirm your registration
   and set your password. Once you confirm your registration, you will receive another containing your user name.

- **Submit a proposal?**
   After logging in, there is a panel on your dashboard titled "Proposals". Within this panel you will see if
   a call is open. Use the icon tools within this panel to create a new proposal. Fill out the proposal form,
   select the appropriate review tracks, and submit it for review. You can track the status of your submission
   by following the link to the Submission at the top of your submitted proposal. All your proposals are listed
   in the "My Proposals" section of Home menu or through the "Proposals" panel on the dashboard.


What if ...
-----------
- **I forgot my password?**
   Contact the User Office and a new password link will be sent to you to reset your password. The link will
   expire after a short period of time, so make sure to use it promptly.

- **I need to change my email address?**
   You can change your email address in your user profile. If you are unable to do so, contact the User Office
   for assistance.

- **One of my team members appears unregistered?**
    If a team member appears unregistered, they may not have completed their registration process. Ask them to
    check their email for the registration confirmation link. If they did not receive it, they can try to register
    again or contact the User Office for assistance. A registered user may appear unregistered if they used a different
    email address to register than the one included in the project. In this case, one of the team leaders can
    update the email address of the team member in the project to match their registered email address.
