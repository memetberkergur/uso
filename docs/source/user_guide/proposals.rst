Proposals
=========

Within the USO system, proposals are the formal requests submitted by users to conduct research at a beamline or
facility. They detail the scientific objectives, expected outcomes, required resources, and list the samples and
other materials the research team will be bringing or using during their proposed experiments. This section provides
a comprehensive guide to managing research proposals within the USO system. It covers everything
from creating a new proposal to tracking its status and responding to reviewer questions.

Cycles
------
The USO system operates on a cycle-based model, typically with two cycles per year. Each cycle is a defined period
during which experiments can be scheduled and performed. However, creation and submission of proposals typically
happens several months prior to the start of the cycle, on a fixed schedule that starts with the Call-for-Proposals.
For example, for beam time scheduled starting in July, the Call-for-Proposals may occur in February of the same year
and last for about a month.  During this period users would create and submit proposals to be reviewed.

Creating a new Proposal
-----------------------
Users can create a new proposal by following the links on "Proposals" panel on their dashboard, or by clicking on
the "New Proposal" link in the "My Proposals" list page available through the :menuselection:`Home --> My Proposals`
menu. This process will open a new proposal form that collects all the necessary information about the proposed
research, including the title, abstract, objectives, and required resources, techniques, beamlines, and samples.

The proposal form is divided into several sections, each accessible through tabs at the top of the form. Each section
focuses on a specific aspect of the proposal, such as the research objectives, team members, materials, and beamlines.

On large screens, a help sidebar is displayed on the right-hand side of the page. Focusing on a given field loads
relevant help text for the field in the help sidebar. A progress bar at the top of the form indicates what percentage
of the form has been completed. The color of the progress bar will change from orange to green when the form
is valid and can be submitted. However, the form can be saved at any point, even while incomplete.
This allows users to return to the proposal later and continue filling it out. To save your progress while editing
the proposal, click the :guilabel:`Save & Continue` button. Clicking the :guilabel:`Save & Preview` button saves
the proposal and redirects to the preview page where you can see the content of the proposal in a formatted
document for reading.


Submitting a Proposal
---------------------
Once the proposal form is complete, users can submit it for review by clicking the :guilabel:`Submit` icon on the
proposal preview page.  Only submitted proposals, also known as Submissions can be reviewed.

The cycles are generally structured as follows:

* **Proposal Lifecycle:** Understanding the stages of a proposal (submitted, under review, accepted, etc.).
* **Tracking Proposal Status:** How to check the status of your submissions.
* **Managing Collaborators:** Adding or removing team members from a proposal.
* **Responding to Reviews:** How to view and respond to feedback from the review committee.
