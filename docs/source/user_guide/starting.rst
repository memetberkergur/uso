===============

Registering and Logging In
--------------------------
To start using the USO system, you need to register for an account. This process typically involves filling out a
registration form with your personal and institutional information.

    Review the declaration before submitting your registration.


Once submitted, you will receive an email with  a link to confirm your registration and set your password.
After confirming your registration, you will receive another email containing your username. Use your username and
password to log-in to the system.


Understanding Your Roles
------------------------
Your assigned roles are important for determining what features of the USO system are exposed to you or what actions
you are allowed to take. In almost all cases, you will only see links, menus, pages or icon-tools that you have
access to.  Roles currently assigned to you will be displayed within the "My Profile" panel on your dashboard.

    labels at the bottom.


The "User" role is the most basic role and is assigned to all users. It allows you to view your profile, manage your
account, and access the dashboard, submit proposals and manager your information such as samples, attachments, etc.
Other roles, such as "Reviewer", "Beamline Staff", or "Administrator", grant additional access to
other features of the system.
